# Billing-system
Necessary Resources:
1. Arduino UNO ATmega328 microcontroller.
2. RFID reader-RC522 SPI.
3. LCD panel 20x4.
4. Buzzer.
5. 9V Battery.
6. RFID Card.
7. GSM module-GSM SIM 900.
8. A Mobile Phone.

Outcomes of The Project:
We canâ€™t imagine the upcoming future in which technology may
occupy each & every place. This innovative project idea can be
used is places like shopping complexes, supermarkets & malls to
purchase the products. Here RFID card is used to securely access
every product in shopping places. If a product is scanned & put
into the cart, all the required details of the product (such as name,
quantity, price & expiry dates )will be displayed on the LCD screen.
Therefore, an RFID tag/card is used for accessing the products.
Hence, this project will help in improving the security & also the
shopping.

project summary: 
The project's purpose is to make it easier for older people and pregnant women to use shopping carts at malls. It also cuts down on long lines at the billing desk during peak hours.
The Feature of our auto trolley is that it follows us by sensing the pre set path. The trolley is equipped with IR module. It traces black line on white surface. This reduces effort of pushing the trolley.
